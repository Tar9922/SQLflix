🌟 Q1: "The First Impression Always Counts"

Points: 🪩 5 points

Task:
Find out when each movie got its very first review (aka the earliest rating date). For every movie title, show:

the title

the first review date (not the average, not the last — the first)

And don’t forget to keep it chic — order them by the first review date so we can see who debuted earliest. 🎬

💡 Hint: Think about the MIN function, bby. Earliest dates = minimum dates. Pair it with GROUP BY.

🎥 Q9: “Actor’s Hall of Fame” ✨

Points: 💎 25 points

Task:
For every actor, spill their most successful movie tea:

🎬 Movie title

🧑‍🎤 Actor name

💰 Revenue (highest they’ve ever bagged)

⭐ Average rating (but only if it’s > 7.5 → because we don’t do flop hits here 😌)

So basically:

Only pick movies that are critically acclaimed (>7.5 avg rating).

Out of those, crown the one movie with max revenue per actor.

💡 Hints:

Step 1: Build a CTE with all actor–movie combos + their avg rating + revenue.

Step 2: Filter where avg_rating > 7.5.

Step 3: Use ROW_NUMBER() partitioned by actor to rank by revenue DESC.

Step 4: Take only rn = 1 for the 🏆 winning movie per actor.

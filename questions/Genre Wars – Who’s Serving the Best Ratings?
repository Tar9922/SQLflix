🌟 Q2: "Genre Wars – Who’s Serving the Best Ratings?"

Points: 💎 8 points

Task:
Group movies by their genre and spill the tea:

🎬 How many unique movies are in that genre

🌟 What’s the average rating (make it neat, round it to 2 decimals)

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 How many distinct users actually gave reviews

This isn’t just “what’s popular,” it’s giving who dominates the cinematic runway genre by genre. 👠

💡 Hint:

Use COUNT(DISTINCT movie_id) to avoid over-counting queens.

AVG is your bff for ratings.

Don’t forget those distinct user_ids — no double-dipping tea ☕.

🎬 Q8: "Genre Glow-Up Timeline"

Points: 💎 30 points

Task:
For each genre, give me the ultimate timeline + crown jewels:

🎉 First Movie Ever (title, year, revenue) → the genre’s baby debut moment

🕰️ Latest Release (title, year, revenue) → the fresh hot drop

👑 Top-Grossing Movie (title, year, revenue) → the money-maker, the diva, the Beyoncé of that genre

So your output should flex:

Genre

First movie + year + revenue

Latest movie + year + revenue

Highest revenue movie + year + revenue

💡 Hints:

Use ROW_NUMBER() over partitions for each genre, ordered by release year and revenue.

Wrap them in a CASE WHEN for that ✨ conditional magic ✨.

Final step: GROUP BY genre to show one row per genre.

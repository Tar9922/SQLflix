🎥 Q15: “Generational Cinema Showdown 👶🧑‍🎤👵”

Points: 💎 50 points (Final Boss)

Task:
Categorize movies into generational buckets (Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha) based on their release years, and compare their cinematic power.

For each generation, spill the stats tea:

🎬 Total Movies Count

💰 Total Revenue (sum across all movies)

⭐ Average Rating

Generational definitions:

👩‍🎤 Millennials → Movies released 1980–1996

🧑 Gen Z → Movies released 1997–2012

👶 Gen Alpha → Movies released 2013+

💡 Hints:

Use 3 SELECT blocks with WHERE release_year filters per generation.

COUNT(DISTINCT movie_id) → to avoid double-counting.

SUM(revenue_million) → generation’s total box office flex.

AVG(rating) → average audience love 💕.

Tie them all together with UNION ALL.

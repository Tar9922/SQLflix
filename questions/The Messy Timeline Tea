🚨 Q4: "The Messy Timeline Tea"

Points: 💥 12 points

Task:
Somebody’s lying in the database 👀. Find the suspicious cases where:

🎬 A movie was apparently released before the actor was even born (umm time travel??).

👶 Or, the actor was cast when they were less than 5 years old (a literal toddler star?).

Your job is to spill the tea by listing out those fishy pairings: movie title, release year, actor name, and their birth year.

💡 Hints:

Use a simple WHERE clause to sniff out those errors.

Think: release_year < birth_year or release_year - birth_year < 5.

This is less about math and more about catching shady business in the data 📉.

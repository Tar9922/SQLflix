🎭 Q3: "Who’s Owning the Spotlight?"

Points: 🌈 10 points

Task:
For each movie, reveal the full cast category breakdown:

👑 How many Leads carried the crown

🤝 How many Supporting babes had their moment

🎉 And the iconic Cameo legends who slid in for a quick slay

Basically… it’s a red carpet headcount for every movie ✨

💡 Hints:

Use COUNT(CASE WHEN ...) to slay each role category individually.

Group by movie_id because every movie’s cast list deserves its own spotlight 💃.

An ORDER BY movie_id will line them up neat, like seats at an award show.

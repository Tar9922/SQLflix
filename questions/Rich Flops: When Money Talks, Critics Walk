🎬 Q6: "Rich Flops: When Money Talks, Critics Walk"

Points: 💥 20 points

Task:
We wanna find movies that were box office rich 💰 but review poor 💔. Specifically:

Movies that earned above the average revenue 🤑.

Movies with an average rating less than 5 (like... unwatchable, but they still made bank).

Your output should show the movie ID, title, its revenue, and its average rating (aka the tea 🍵).

💡 Hints:

Use a variable (@Average_Revenue) to calculate the average across all movies.

Build a CTE to compute average ratings per movie.

Then join it all up and filter with the conditions (rich but flop).

Don’t forget: Order by lowest rating first so we see the true disasters on top 🔝.

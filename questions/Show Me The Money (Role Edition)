💰 Q5: "Show Me The Money (Role Edition)"

Points: 🔥 15 points

Task:
Let’s figure out how much the actors bagged 💼 based on their roles across movies.

🌟 Lead actors secure 40% of the box office revenue (main character energy).

💃 Supporting actors get 30% (still iconic, just not the icon).

👀 Cameo stars snatch 10% (blink-and-you-miss-it but still got paid).

Your mission is to display each actor’s name, ID, and their total revenue across all roles they’ve ever played.

💡 Hints:

Use CASE WHEN inside SUM() for conditional role-based earnings.

Don’t forget to GROUP BY actor so their totals stack up nicely.

Think of it like splitting a pizza 🍕 where leads eat almost half, supports get a big slice, cameos nibble.
